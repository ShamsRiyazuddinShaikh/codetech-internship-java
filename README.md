This Java program demonstrates how to interact with text files by reading from, writing to, and modifying them. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this program is an excellent way to understand file handling in Java. It allows you to learn about file I/O (input/output) operations using Java’s standard libraries, such as FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter.

In this program, we will cover:

Reading from a text file: Using Java’s BufferedReader to read content line by line.
Writing to a text file: Using FileWriter and BufferedWriter to write new content to a file.
Modifying an existing file: Reading the file's content, making changes to it, and then saving it back to the file.
Program Features
Reading a File:

The program can open an existing text file and read its contents line by line.
It supports handling files with varying sizes and formats.
Writing to a File:

You can create a new file or overwrite an existing file by writing content into it.
It allows writing text with proper formatting and line breaks.
Modifying a File:

The program can read content from an existing file, modify its content (e.g., adding, updating, or deleting text), and save the changes back to the file.
Program Explanation:
readFile Method:

Opens the file in read mode using FileReader and BufferedReader.
Reads the file line by line and prints the content to the console.
writeToFile Method:

Opens the file in write mode using FileWriter and BufferedWriter.
Writes new content to the file, overwriting any existing content.
modifyFile Method:

Opens the file in append mode using FileWriter with the true parameter.
Appends new content to the existing file, leaving the current data intact.
How to Use the Program
Create a Text File:

Before running the program, ensure that you have a text file (sample.txt) with some initial content in it.
If the file does not exist, the program will create a new one when writing or modifying content.
Run the Program:

When you run the program, it will first read and display the contents of sample.txt.
Then, it will overwrite the file with new content.
Finally, it will append more content to the file.
Verify the Changes:

After running the program, open sample.txt to verify the read, written, and modified content.

This Java application demonstrates how to consume a public REST API to fetch weather data and display it in a structured format. For this example, we will use the OpenWeatherMap API, which is a popular API that provides real-time weather data for any location. The application fetches the current weather data for a given city and displays it in a structured, easy-to-read format.

The main objective of this program is to show how to:

Consume a REST API using Java.
Parse JSON data returned by the API.
Display structured weather information like temperature, humidity, weather description, and more.
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): This program requires JDK 8 or later.
Maven: To handle dependencies, we will use Maven to manage external libraries.
OpenWeatherMap API Key: You need to sign up at OpenWeatherMap and generate an API key to access the weather data.
Explanation:
Dependencies:

We use Apache HTTPClient to send an HTTP GET request to fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
We use Gson (Google's JSON library) to parse the JSON response from the API and extract the required data.
getWeatherData Method:

This method constructs the URL using the city name and API key, sends the GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and retrieves the JSON response.
parseAndDisplayWeatherData Method:

The method parses the JSON response to extract weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather description.
It then formats and displays the data in a user-friendly, structured format.
API Key:

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
City Name:

The city name ("London") is hardcoded, but you can modify the program to accept user input or fetch data for multiple cities.
7. Running the Program
Replace API Key: Make sure you replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.
Compile and Run:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project folder where your WeatherApp.java is located.


This Java application demonstrates how to build a client-server chat application using Java Sockets and Multithreading to handle communication between multiple users. In this chat application:

The server listens for incoming client connections and establishes communication channels for each connected client.
Each client can send and receive messages in real-time.
The server uses multithreading to handle multiple clients concurrently, allowing users to chat with one another.
This application will help you understand:

Socket Programming: Communication between the client and server over a network.
Multithreading: Handling multiple client connections concurrently without blocking the server.
Real-time Messaging: Sending and receiving messages in real-time.
Features
Server Side:
Accepts multiple client connections.
Creates a separate thread for each client to handle communication.
Forwards messages from one client to all other clients (broadcasting).
Client Side:
Connects to the server.
Sends messages to the server.
Receives and displays messages from other clients in real-time.
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): This program requires JDK 8 or later.
Basic Knowledge of Java Sockets and Multithreading: Familiarity with Java networking and threads will help understand the concepts behind this application.
Setup Instructions
1. Install Java
Download and install JDK 8 or later from the official Oracle website.
Verify the installation by running:
sh
Copy
java -version
2. Create Project Structure
Create a new folder for your project (e.g., ChatApp).
Inside the folder, create two directories:
src/main/java for your Java classes.
Inside src/main/java, create the following classes:
Server.java (Handles the server-side logic).
Client.java (Handles the client-side logic).
3. Java Program Code
Below is the implementation for both the server and client.

Explanation:
Server Class:
ServerSocket: The server listens on a specific port (12345) for incoming client connections.
ClientHandler Thread: Each time a new client connects, a new ClientHandler thread is created. This thread reads messages from the client and broadcasts them to all connected clients.
Broadcasting: When a client sends a message, the server forwards it to all other clients that are connected.
Client Class:
Socket: The client creates a socket to connect to the server at localhost on port 12345.
Input and Output Streams: The client uses BufferedReader and PrintWriter to send and receive messages from the server.
Multithreading: A new thread is created to handle incoming messages from the server, while the main thread waits for the user to type a message and sends it to the server.


This project demonstrates how to build a Recommendation System using Java and Apache Mahout. The system suggests products or content based on user preferences by utilizing Collaborative Filtering techniques.

Apache Mahout is an open-source machine learning library that provides tools for building scalable and efficient machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering, clustering, classification, and more.

In this project, we will:

Build a recommendation system based on user preferences (e.g., product ratings).
Use Collaborative Filtering to suggest products/content that users may like based on the preferences of similar users.
Leverage the Apache Mahout library to process large datasets and generate recommendations.
Features
Collaborative Filtering: The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to generate product recommendations for users based on past preferences.
Matrix Factorization: Using Mahout's algorithms for matrix factorization to suggest items based on user-item interactions.
Similarity-Based Recommendations: The system finds users or items that are similar to the current user's preferences and suggests them accordingly.
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): JDK 8 or higher is required.
Apache Mahout: Mahout is used to perform the machine learning computations. The project uses Mahout's collaborative filtering algorithms.
Maven: The project is managed using Maven to handle dependencies and build the application.
Dataset: A dataset containing user-item interactions (e.g., product ratings).
